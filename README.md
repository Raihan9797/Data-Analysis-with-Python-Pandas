# Data-Science
This is my own introduction to Data Science using Python Pandas, a bit of numpy and also abit of scikitlearn. Been learning Data Science using R so this is just a mapping over to Python. I used this playlist here by [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLw1RNvfElg&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfSfqQuee6K8opKtZsh7sA9). It's a great resource of just 6 videos that will run you through the fundamentals along with other Python tutorials. You can also check out a text-based version of the resource [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-python3-pandas-data-analysis/)

I write down my issues along the way especially in the form of troubleshooting as most times, it's these small things that those who are well versed in Python would not think to point out especially because they have solved their own issues a long time ago and might not even remember such problems. I basically log down these issues, how I resolved them and the resources I used to solve the problem.
